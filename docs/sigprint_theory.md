# SIGPRINT Integration: Ω‑Field Theoretical Foundation

## Complete Framework for EEG‑Consciousness Interface

## I. Theoretical Grounding

### A. SIGPRINT as Ω‑Field Measurement

```
SIGPRINT = Compressed measurement of Ω-field state

Core insight:
  EEG 8Hz alpha = Λ (phase) oscillation
  Lock-in detection = measuring ψ and Λ directly
  
Mapping:
  Amplitude A = ψ (coherence strength)
  Phase φ = Λ (awareness phase)
  Spatial coherence = ∫ψ² across regions
  Phase synchrony = alignment of Λ across channels

Therefore:
  SIGPRINT encodes (ψ, Λ) snapshot
  20 digits = compressed Ω-state
  Time series = Ω-field evolution
```

**Why 8 Hz specifically:**

```
Alpha band (8-12 Hz):
  - Relaxed wakefulness
  - Default mode network activity
  - Consciousness "carrier wave"
  
8 Hz center:
  - Peak of alpha distribution
  - Schumann resonance (7.83 Hz) proximity
  - Optimal for phase coherence measurement
  
In Ω-field terms:
  8 Hz = fundamental frequency of conscious Λ
```

### Carrier Analogy (Radio)

- Carrier wave in radio transmission ↔ alpha carrier in EEG.
- Information (thoughts) modulates this carrier; lock‑in demodulation recovers quadratures (I/Q) → `A ≈ ψ`, `φ ≈ Λ`.
- Narrowband focus around 8–12 Hz improves phase stability and coherence estimates.

### B. Cybernetic Order of SIGPRINT System

System architecture:

```
Order 1 (Classical):
  EEG → Computer → Display
  Observer (user) external to system
  
Order 2 (Reflexive):
  EEG → SIGPRINT → Voice journal
  User observes own brain state
  Feedback: "I see my coherence is 87"
  
Order 3 (Framework‑Modifying):
  EEG + Journal → Pattern recognition → Protocol adjustment
  System modifies stimulus (RHZ Stylus)
  Framework changes: F(stimulus) → F'(stimulus)
  Persistent: New protocols based on learned patterns
  
Order 4 (Identity):
  User ≡ System
  SIGPRINT becomes part of self‑model
  No separation between observer and observed
  Unity recognition through data
```

Current implementation is Order 2–3:
- Real‑time feedback (Order 2) via `host.sigprint.structured_cli` and Voice Journal.
- Protocol modification (Order 3) via controller policy → RHZ Stylus.
- Aims toward Order 4 (identity integration) through stable feedback loops and journaling.

### Operational Bridge to Implementation
- Lock‑in (radio analog): multiply EEG by `cos(2π·f0·t)` and `sin(2π·f0·t)`, low‑pass → `A ≈ ψ`, `φ ≈ Λ` per channel.
- Ω‑metrics: spatial ∫ψ² (coherence), PLV/Kuramoto (phase order), phase entropy, envelope correlations.
- Compression: deterministic 20‑digit SIGPRINT per second capturing phase topology, amplitude distribution, coherence/PLV, context, checksum.
- Dynamics: time series of codes; Hamming transitions define loops (stable) vs gates (bifurcations).
